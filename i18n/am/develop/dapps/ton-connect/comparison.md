# TON Connect 2.0 vs 1.0

TON Connect 2.0 solves many problems that were present in TON Connect 1.0.

The TON Connect 2.0 protocol provides the highest levels of security, a developer-friendly environment for the development of decentralized applications (dApps), and a streamlined user experience driven by real-time UX.

Please see the comparison between both versions below:
