# Transaction Fees

Every TON user should keep in mind that _commission depends on many factors_.

## Gas

All fees are calculated in Gas. It's a special currency for fees in TON.

All fees are nominated and fixed in a certain gas amount, but the gas price itself is not fixed. Today the price for gas is:

```cpp
1 gas = 1000 nanotons = 0,000 001 TON
```

### Average transaction cost

> **TLDR:** Today, every transaction costs around **~0.005 TON**

Even if TON price increases 100 times, transactions will remain ultra-cheap; less than $0.01. Moreover, validators may lower this value if they see commissions have become expensive [read why they're interested](#gas-changing-voting-process).

:::info
The current gas amount is written in the Network Config [param 20](https://explorer.toncoin.org/config?workchain=-1\&shard=8000000000000000\&seqno=22185244\&roothash=165D55B3CFFC4043BFC43F81C1A3F2C41B69B33D6615D46FBFD2036256756382\&filehash=69C43394D872B02C334B75F59464B2848CD4E23031C03CA7F3B1F98E8A13EE05#configparam20).

### Gas changing voting process

The gas fee, like many other parameters of TON, is configurable and may be changed by a special vote made in the mainnet.

Changing any parameter requires getting 66% of the validator votes.

#### Could gas cost more?

> _Does it mean that one day gas prices could rise by 1,000 times or even more?_

Technically, yes; but in fact, no.

Validators receive a small fee for processing transactions, and charging higher commissions will lead to a decrease in the number of transactions which will make the validating process less beneficial.

### How to calculate fees?

Fees on TON are difficult to calculate in advance, as their amount depends on transaction run time, account status, message content and size, blockchain network settings, and a number of other variables that cannot be calculated until the transaction is sent. Read about [computation fees](/develop/howto/fees-low-level#computation-fees) in low-level article overview.

That is why even NFT marketplaces usually take an extra amount of TON (_~1 TON_) and return (_`1 - transaction_fee`_) later.

However, let's read more about how fees are supposed to function on TON.

## Basic Fees Formula

According to the [low-level fees overview](/develop/howto/fees-low-level), fees on TON are calculated by this formula:

```cpp
transaction_fee = storage_fees
                + in_fwd_fees
                + computation_fees
                + action_fees
                + out_fwd_fees
```

## Elements of transaction fee

- `storage_fees` is the amount you pay for storing a smart contract in the blockchain. In fact, you pay for every second the smart contract is stored on the blockchain.
  - _Example_: your TON Wallet is also a smart contract, and it pays a storage fee every time you receive or send a transaction. Read more about [how storage fees are calculated](/develop/smart-contracts/fees#storage-fee).
- `in_fwd_fees` is a charge for importing messages from outside the blockchain. Every time you make a transaction, it must be delivered to the validators who will process it.
  - _Example_: each transaction you make with your wallet app (like Tonkeeper) requires first to be distributed among validation nodes.
- `computation_fees` is the amount you pay for executing code in the virtual machine. The larger the code, the more fees must be paid.
  - _Example_: each time you send a transaction with your wallet (which is a smart contract), you execute the code of your wallet contract and pay for it.
- `action_fees` is a charge for sending outgoing messages made by a smart contract.
- `out_fwd_fees` stands for a charge for sending messages outside from TON Blockchain to interact with off-chain services (e.g., logs) and external blockchains.
  - Not used because it's not implemented. So today is equal to 0.

## Storage fee

TON validators collect storage fees from smart contracts.

Storage fees are collected from the smart contract balance at the **Storage phase** of any transaction. Read more about phases and how TVM works [here](/learn/tvm-instructions/tvm-overview#transactions-and-phases).

It’s important to keep in mind that on TON you pay for both the execution of a smart contract and for the **used storage**:

```cpp
bytes * second
```

It means you have to pay a storage fee for having TON Wallet (even if it's very-very small).

If you have not used your TON Wallet for a significant period of time (1 year), _you will have to pay a significantly larger commission than usual because the wallet pays commission on sending and receiving transactions_.

### Formula

You can approximately calculate storage fees for smart contracts using this formula:

```cpp
  storage_fee = (cells_count * cell_price + bits_count * bit_price)
  / 2^16 * time_delta
```

Let's examine each value more closely:

- `price`—price for storage for `time_delta` seconds
- `cells_count`—count of cells used by smart contract
- `bits_count`—count of bits used by smart contract
- `cell_price`—price of single cell
- `bit_price`—price of single bit

Both `cell_price` and `bit_price` could be obtained from Network Config [param 18](https://explorer.toncoin.org/config?workchain=-1\&shard=8000000000000000\&seqno=22185244\&roothash=165D55B3CFFC4043BFC43F81C1A3F2C41B69B33D6615D46FBFD2036256756382\&filehash=69C43394D872B02C334B75F59464B2848CD4E23031C03CA7F3B1F98E8A13EE05#configparam18).

Current values are:

- Workchain.
  ```cpp
  bit_price_ps:1
  cell_price_ps:500
  ```
- Masterchain.
  ```cpp
  mc_bit_price_ps:1000
  mc_cell_price_ps:500000
  ```

### Calculator Example

You can use this JS script to calculate storage price for 1 MB in the workchain for 1 year

```js live

// Welcome to LIVE editor!
// feel free to change any variables
  
function storageFeeCalculator() {
  
  const size = 1024 * 1024 * 8		    // 1MB in bits  
  const duration = 60 * 60 * 24 * 365	// 1 Year in secs

  const bit_price_ps = 1
  const cell_price_ps = 500

  const pricePerSec = size * bit_price_ps +
  + Math.ceil(size / 1023) * cell_price_ps

  let fee = (pricePerSec * duration / 2**16 * 10**-9)
  let mb = (size / 1024 / 1024 / 8).toFixed(2)
  let days = Math.floor(duration / (3600 * 24))
  
  let str = `Storage Fee: ${fee} TON (${mb} MB for ${days} days)`
  
  return str
}


```

## FAQ
