# Introduction

Smart contract creation, development, and deployment on TON Blockchain leverages the [FunC programming language](/develop/smart-contracts/#func-language) and [TON Virtual Machine (TVM)](/develop/smart-contracts/#ton-virtual-machine).

## Quick Start: Your First Smart Contract

Write and deploy your first smart contract with the _Blueprint_ framework.

Blueprint is a development environment for writing, testing, and deploying smart contracts.
To create a new demo project use the following command:

```bash
npm create ton@latest
```

### TON Course

We're proud to present the **TON Blockchain Course**, which is a comprehensive guide to the TON Blockchain. The course is designed for developers who want to learn how to create smart contracts and decentralized applications on the TON Blockchain.

It consists of **9 modules** and covers the basics of the TON Blockchain, smart contract development lifecycle, the FunC programming, and the TON Virtual Machine (TVM).

## Examples of Smart Contracts

Explore ready-made smart contract examples and tools provided by the TON community.

:::info little tip
Feel free to focus on smart contracts written using _FunC_. Focusing on smart contracts written using FunC (_.fc) instead of the lower-level Fift (_.fif) language is often better.
:::

Standard examples of smart contracts on TON include wallets, electors (which manage validation on TON), and multi-signature wallets, which can be a reference when studying.
