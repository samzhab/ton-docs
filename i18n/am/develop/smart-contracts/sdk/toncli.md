## Installation üíæ

### Docker: linux / macOS (m1 supported)

- Docker-hub pre-build images can be founded [here](https://hub.docker.com/r/trinketer22/func_docker/)
- Docker files with instructions can be founded [here](https://github.com/Trinketer22/func_docker)

### Linux / macOS (intel)

1. Download the necessary special pre-builds (use the latest build)

- for Linux: [here](https://github.com/SpyCheese/ton/actions/workflows/ubuntu-compile.yml?query=branch%3Atoncli-local++)
- for Mac: [here](https://github.com/SpyCheese/ton/actions/workflows/macos-10.15-compile.yml?query=branch%3Atoncli-local)

:::info Download special pre-builds tip
To download the necessary files, you must log-in to your account
:::

2. Install [Python3.9](https://www.python.org/downloads/) or higher

3. Run in terminal `pip install toncli` or `pip3 install toncli`

:::tip Possible error
If you see `WARNING: The script toncli is installed in '/Python/3.9/bin' which is not on PATH`, then add the full path to bin to the PATH env
:::

4. Run `toncli` and pass absolute path to `func/fift/lite-client` from first step

### Windows

1. Download the necessary special pre-builds from [here](https://github.com/SpyCheese/ton/actions/workflows/win-2019-compile.yml?query=branch%3Atoncli-local) (use the latest build)

:::info Download special pre-builds tip
To download the necessary files, you must log-in to your account
:::

2. Install [Python3.9](https://www.python.org/downloads/) or higher

:::info Very important!
During installation, on the first screen, you need to click the `Add Python to PATH` checkbox
:::

3. Open the terminal as an administrator and `pip install toncli` by installing `toncli`

4. Unzip the downloaded archive and add [libcrypto-1_1-x64.dll](https://disk.yandex.ru/d/BJk7WPwr_JT0fw) to unziped files

5. Open the folder in the console for windows users:

**Windows 11**:

- Right mouse button, open in the terminal

**Windows 10**:

- Copy the path in Explorer and run in Terminal `cd FULL PATH`

## Create a project ‚úèÔ∏è

These are simple steps to deploy an example smart contract in TON.
You can read the official documentation [here](https://github.com/disintar/toncli/blob/master/docs/quick_start_guide.md)

### Step-by-step guide

1. Open the terminal as an administrator and go to your project folder

2. To create a project, run `toncli start YOUR-PROJECT-NAME`

3. Go to the project folder `cd YOUR-PROJECT-NAME`

:::info Result

- build
- func
- fift
- test
  :::

4. You can deploy it to testnet or mainnet: `toncli deploy -n testnet`

## Examples

Contributors have prepared sample projects very well covered by the new tests. For example, now two commands can be used to deploy an NFT collection or a Jetton.

```bash
toncli start nft_colletion/jetton_minter/nft_item/jetton_wallet
```

All of these projects have a lot of interesting examples of toncli and blockchain interaction, as well as extremely tests that will help in developing custom smart contracts.
